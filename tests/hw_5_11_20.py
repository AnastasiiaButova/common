Write a program that will take the num parameter being passed and return the number of hours and minutes
the parameter converts to (ie. if num = 63 then the output should be 1:3). Separate the number of hours and minutes with a colon.cd

Write a program that will take the parameter being passed and return the largest word in the string. 
If there are two or more words that are the same length, return the first word from the string with that length. Ignore punctuation.
Sample Test Cases:
Input:"fun&!! time"
Output:time

Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order.
For example:
Input: My name is Michele
